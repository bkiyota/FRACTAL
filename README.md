## FRACTAL Code Ocean version

FRACTAL is available as a [Code Ocean capsule](https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.2433997.v1) as well as at GitHub. This branch contains all the files provided as a Code Ocean capsule in the future.

Please note that **the deep distributed computing mode of FRACTAL is disabled in this version** because Univa Grid Engine (UGE) is not supported by Code Ocean. The original code is avaialble at https://github.com/yachielab/FRACTAL.
