name: 'FRACTAL: framework for distributed computing to trace large accurate lineages'
description: FRACTAL (framework for distributed computing to trace large accurate lineages) is a new deep distributed computing framework that is designated to reconstruct extremely large lineages of nucleotide sequences using a software tool of choice. In brief, FRACTAL first subsamples a small number of sequences to reconstruct only an upper hierarchy of a target lineage and assigns the remaining sequences to its downstream clades, for each of which the same procedure is recursively iterated. Since the iteration procedure can be performed in parallel in a distributed computing framework, FRACTAL allows highly scalable reconstruction of an extremely large lineage tree.
